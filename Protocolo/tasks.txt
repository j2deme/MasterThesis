Set up the client
- Study the different image compression techniques
- Choose and implement a set of image compression techniques
- Test and compare the implementations of the selected techniques
- Implement a client application to capture images
- Implement the selected compression technique on the client

Set up the server
- Study the different web services models
- Choose the most suitable web service model for the problem
- Mount a local web server
- Implement the web service architecture on the server
- Implement the decompression technique
- Connect the client and the server

Adequate the Facial Gestures Analysis Algorithm
- Link the algorithm to the reception-decompression mechanism
- Link the algorithm to the mechanism for the processing of results.
- Create a user interface to visualize the results from the analysis.

Test the architecture
- Design a set of experiments to test the architecture
- Apply and analyze the designed experiments
- Adjust parameters of the architecture based on the results from the experiments

Document the architecture
