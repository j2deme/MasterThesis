%%%%%%RESUMEN
\chapter{Abstract}
%\subsection{Resumen}

Nowadays our world is mainly dominated by the technology, we live in a society where the technological advantages are part of our daily basis, and depend on their use to perform our daily tasks.\\

Many of the technological advantages have come to help other areas as the economy, arts and business, just to mention a few, and unquestionably the use of technology in the recruitment of human resources is a very prolific area to work, with the use of multiple technological equipments that help in the local, national and international scope.\\

Although this technology is available and provides the services to whom is able to pay it, many business and startups do not count with the sufficient monetary resource as to pay for that service, in case they do, they also have the need to hire qualified people, and they are force to do it locally and in an specific context.\\

Here is where the use of technological advantages enters the game, specially with the use of Internet connections, now available for almost everyone, even on remote places; chained with the use of a web service that allows the capture, transmission and generation of analysis, in reports available everywhere an Internet connection is provided.\\

Web services offer an independent software alternative, considering platforms, based on standars for application integration, business process automation y multi source information publishing. The quality of a web service is vital for any organization looking forward to a technological integration. Having an integrated, scalable and available infrastructure lower costs and allows sharing information in a reliable way.\\

\chapter{Introduction}\label{cap1}

For people working in the recruitment areas of the industries, business and startups, the ability to differ if an applicant agrees with a set of questions, or whether if they are saying the true about their personal information and achievements, is relevant and helpful.\\

This thesis was dedicated to the provision of a computational tool, focused on the help of decision making in business. To be more specific, in the recruitment process of new human resource and business meetings.\\

The obtained product is a web service that helps in the processing of signal of captured images and videos, to determine the veracity of a set of emotions, given an specific range for each emotion wanted to detect.\\

The analysis are made based on the capture of set of images and videos, which are processed by an algorithm, and compressed by a transmission method, which sends the information to a web service, in which the information sent is processed, analyzed and translated to graphics, tables, and human comprehensible results, which help in the decision making process.\\

\section{Problem Statement}\label{problemstatement}
Given a sequence of images from the face, taken in a client computer, where the illumination conditions and background motion are restricted, the problem of analyzing facial gestures on the web, could be stated as an architecture that allows transmission of compressed images through a web service, in order to produce an analysis of facial gestures (by the use of an existing algorithm). This algorithm focuses on the detection of symmetry of facial gesticulations and its goal is to help in the decision-making process. From this we state the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Considering the speed of Internet connections in M\'exico, what techniques can be used to increase the speed of image transfer?
\item Which type of web service is more suitable for image transmission/analysis?
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OBJETIVOS
\section{Objectives}
\subsection{General}
Design a web architecture that allows the efficient transmission of facial image sequences to compute an analysis about the behaviour of facial gesticulations, in order to obtain symmetrical/asymmetrical motion patterns which might be used for the decision-making process.
\subsection{Specific}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement an image compression technique that allows fast Internet broadcasting.
\item Design and implement a web architecture for the reception and decompression of compressed images.
\item Adapt a given algorithm for the analysis of gesticulations in the transmitted images.
\item Design a set of experiments to test the web architecture.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HIPOTESIS
\section{Hypothesis}\label{hipotesis}
Nowadays, Internet technologies are optimized for low bandwidth consumption; nonetheless, in order to obtain a more efficient analysis it is necessary to reduce the amount transfered information. At this point image compression techniques could increase the speed of the analysis by providing fast transmission of images through Internet.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LIMITACIONES...
\section{Research Scope and Constraints}
The proposed architecture is focused only on the compression-transmission process of images, it does not consider the motion from other regions of the body. Moreover, the mechanisms for the analysis of the image sequences were generated in collaboration with researchers of the Universidad Polit\'ecnica de Victoria and are only used, but not implemented.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%JUSTIFICACION
\section{Justification and Motivation}
Human interaction is very important in many different aspects in our daily life, such as business meeting, medical diagnostics, etc. However, thanks to the improvement of technology, these operations can be done remotely, which can be especially useful when the distance is considered a barrier. Nevertheless, this produces another problem which is the lack of physical gesture appreciation (product of non-face-to-face interaction), since gesture communication is considered as an important part in human communication. To solve this issue, we propose the use of a web service that allows to evaluate gestures remotely.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METODOLOGIA
%\newpage
\chapter{Methodology}\label{capIII}
The methodology followed in the development of this thesis was basically divided into 4 stages:
\begin{description}
\item[1st Stage] In this stage, the different techniques for image compression/decompression were studied, in order to choose a set of them to be implemented and tested. Once the implementations of the selected techniques were made, they were tested and compared to choose one that was integrated into a client application. This client application is responsible of capturing the images for their compression by the selected technique.

\item[2nd Stage] In this stage, the different approaches for web services were analyzed, to choose the most appropriate solution for the problem to be solved. Also, a local web server was mounted, in order to implement the chosen web service model. Once the web service was implemented, the decompression technique to reverse the technique selected on the previous stage, was setup on the web service, this, in order to connect the client to the server to send the compressed images, and then testing the process of transmission-reception-decompression. Based on the results from the previous tests, the necessary adjustments were made to ensure both the proper functioning of the connection between the client and server, and the reception of the original image as captured by the client.

\item[3rd Stage] In this stage, the work was focused on the adaptation of the algorithm for facial gestures analysis, since it was originally developed to work in a local environment. This adaptation included a mechanism to interact with the compression/decompression technique previously developed, and a mechanism to retrieve and process the results from the facial gesture analysis algorithm, also, a user interface for displaying the results of the analysis was created.

\item[4th Stage] Finally, a set of experiments oriented to test the different components of the architecture (such as compression, quality of results, processing time, etc.) were developed and applied.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CONCLUSIONES
\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusiones}
As a professional in the Information Technology area, I consider the importance of the application of knowledge, to projects that help to improve the life quality, as well the development of applications that help people in other areas in order to optimize their working process.

That is the reason of why, the purpose of the present thesis was to generate an application that helps in the process of facial gestures analysis in remote environments, while and after a live interview or meeting.

In order to develop the application, as was previously commented, many tests with different available technologies were made, to choose one focused in the development of web services. Those technologies, as a part of the information technologies area, are always in constant evolution and update, as well as the technologies used in image compression, as everyday in our globalized world this area is in constant research of new architectures, technologies and tools that help the optimization of resources and the reduction of costs in the process done with technological tools.

In the set of tests done with the developed software, the results obtained, indicate that the process of capture and results analysis is easy to comprehend, without the need of major information technology knowledge.
